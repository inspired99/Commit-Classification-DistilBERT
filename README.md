## Multilabel Commit Classification using DistilBERT 

### Test Task for Project on Autocompletion of commit messages.

The task is to classify commits by maintenance activities. There are 3 categories: Corrective, Adaptive and Perfective. Each commit massage may have more than one label at once. This problem was chosen because such classification is essential for understanding the goal of particular commits, also it would be really significant to know what type of commit it is by it's message without looking at diffs. Developers could use such categories to label their commits and in the future it would be easier to search for commit among particular label. So, there are both a practical and a research reason.

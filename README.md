## Multilabel Commit Classification using DistilBERT 

### Task for Project on Autocompletion of commit messages

The task is to classify commits by maintenance activities. There are 3 categories: Corrective, Adaptive and Perfective. Each commit massage may have more than one label at once. The problem was chosen because such classification is essential for understanding the goal of particular commits, also it would be really significant to distinguish type of the commit by it's message without looking at diffs. Developers could use such categories to label their commits and in the future it would be easier to search for commit via label. So, there are both a practical and a research reason.
